* 1.0.4 - Bug fix thanks to [Njal Karevoll](https://github.com/nkvoll). No longer relies on newline after the null-byte frame separator. Library is now compatible with RabbitMQ stomp adapter.
* 1.1.1 - Support for binary messages.
* 1.1.2 - Fixed issue with stomper adding a space in ACK message-id header. ActiveMQ 5.6.0 no longer tolerates this.
* 2.0a1 - Complete redesign: feature-complete implementation of STOMP 1.0 and 1.1. Broker failover. Decoupled from [stomper](http://code.google.com/p/stomper/).
* 2.0a2 - Heart-beating.
* 2.0a3 - Implementation of STOMP 1.2 (except repeated header entries). Support for UTF-8 headers and escaping of header delimiting characters (STOMP 1.1 and 1.2).
* 2.0a4 - Improved STOMP protocol version. Minor incompatible changes of the low-level API (protocol.session and protocol.commands). Bugfixes headers encoding.
* 2.0a5 - Factored out stompest.async into a separate PyPI package to make the stompest library self-consistent.
* 2.1.0 - Generic Listener API.
